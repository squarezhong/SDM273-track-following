# SDM273-Track-Following-Robot

## Introduction

## Development Plan
- [x] Drive two motors
- [ ] Read the track following sensor
- [ ] Implement a PID controller to follow the track
- [ ] Stop at a horizontal line
- [ ] Use two laser sensors to detect distance to an obstacle
- [ ] Use filter and neural network to process the sensor data, and calculate the result

- [ ] (Optional) After stopping at a horizontal line, calibrate the position of the robot
